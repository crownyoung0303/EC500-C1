# EC500-C1 Homework 3

## Project Goals
- Learn mongdb</br  >
- Design DB for project 1</br  >
- Test prooperties of your deisgn</br  >

## How to run the program:
1. Download all files (including py and json)<br />
2. Install mongodb follow the guides [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/installation/)
3. Run the py files.

## Differences between MangoDB and MySQL
1. MangoDB and MySQL support different types of data structures, MangoDB only supports dictionary in python while MySQL supports the integer, text and others.<br />
2. MySQL is safer than MangoDB because MySQL allows the users to set up passwords for the database to protect the themselves while MongoDB lacks this kind of protection.<br />. 
3. Before using MangoDb, you should connect to the port first but you don't have to do those pre-processes while using MySQL.<br />
4. MySQL will generate a db file after inserting all the data, which is
more visable for user, you will have to download some software like ROBO 3T to see the data in MongoDB.
MongoDB's visualization is not that good and you need to install software like ROBO 3T to observe it. However, MySQL will generate a .db file which is easier for you to deal with.

# EC500-C1 Homework 2

## Project Goals
- Comprehensive Code Review</br  >
- Develop Test scenarios and scripts</br  >
- Build a local home page</br  >

## How to run the program:
1. Download form.py and hw2.py
2. Install [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
```
pip install tweepy

Because my program is ran on windows, we should also change the environment variables.

Second, create credentials in the APIs & Services and download it.
Last, change the json file name to 'service-account-file.json' that are corresponding to the homework1.py.
```
10. Run the hw2.py and form.py<br />
We will get a [form.html](https://github.com/crownyoung0303/EC500-C1/blob/master/HW2/Web_Video/results/form.html) and a [hw2_form.html](https://github.com/crownyoung0303/EC500-C1/blob/master/HW2/Web_Video/results/hw2_form.html).<br />

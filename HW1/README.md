## How to run the program:

3. Install FFMpeg

Because my program is ran on windows, we should change the environment variables
```
4. Install Wget using Pip install
```
pip install wget
```
5. Get your credentials and access token from your twitter account by following steps [here](https://www.slickremix.com/docs/how-to-get-api-keys-and-tokens-for-twitter/)
6. Put your token information into HW1API.py
7. Get your Google Vision API Credentials following steps [here](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/auth)

python2 HW1API.py
```
9. DONE! Check for outputvid.mp4 as the video of the images and labels.json as the decription of your images

Note: This API is developed on macOS10.13.3. If you are using Windows OS, comment line 75 in HW1API.py and uncomment line 74.
